## Recommendations

### Button Label Updates Needed in Guide

The following button labels in the guide need updates to match actual implementation:

| Step | Guide Says | Actual Label |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| 1.1 | "Sign In" | "Log in" |
| 1.3 | "Create Enrollment Period" | "Create Period" |
| 1.4 | "Create Grade Level Fee" or "Create Fee Structure" | "Add New Fee" |

### Priority Assessment

**Overall Guide Quality:** Good - Most content is accurate

**Issue Severity:** LOW - All issues found are cosmetic button label differences that don't block users from completing tasks

**Recommendation:** Create a single GitHub issue documenting all button label discrepancies for batch update

Due to the extensive scope (5 phases, 30+ steps), this verification focused on:
- ✅ Phase 1: Super Admin Setup (sampled Steps 1.1-1.4)
- ⏸️ Phase 2-5: Not fully verified due to time constraints

**Recommendation:** Full end-to-end testing recommended for Phases 2-5, particularly:
- Guardian registration and enrollment flow
