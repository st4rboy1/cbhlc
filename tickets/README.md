## Remaining Work ðŸ”´

### Ticket 008: Invoice PDF Download
**Status:** Not yet implemented
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** 4-6 hours

**Description:**
Currently, guardians can view invoices in the browser and use print-to-PDF functionality. However, there's no server-side PDF generation for invoices, which would provide:
- Professional, consistently formatted PDF invoices
- School branding and official appearance
- Downloadable invoice documents
- Better record-keeping for guardians

**Technical Implementation:**
- Leverage existing DomPDF setup from tickets 002, 005, 006
- Create invoice PDF template in `resources/views/pdf/invoice.blade.php`
- Add `downloadInvoicePDF()` method to `InvoiceController`
- Add download route and button to invoice view

**Dependency:** Backend PDF infrastructure (âœ… already exists via DomPDF)
