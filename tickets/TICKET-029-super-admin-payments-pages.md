## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Test all CRUD operations work correctly

## Dependencies

- [TICKET-025](./TICKET-025-fix-navigation-issues.md) - Should add navigation link after this is done
- [TICKET-028](./TICKET-028-super-admin-invoices-pages.md) - Invoice pages (for invoice links)

## Notes

- Payment recording should update invoice balance automatically
- Refunded payments should not be editable
- Consider adding receipt generation (future enhancement)
- Consider adding batch payment import (future enhancement)
- May need to add navigation link in Super Admin sidebar after completion
- Ensure proper authorization for refund action (super admin only)
- Payment method badges should have different colors
- Status transitions: pending â†’ completed or failed
- Once completed, can only be refunded (not edited)
