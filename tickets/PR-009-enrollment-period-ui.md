/>
```

### PeriodTimeline

```tsx
<PeriodTimeline
    startDate={period.start_date}
    endDate={period.end_date}
    earlyDeadline={period.early_registration_deadline}
    regularDeadline={period.regular_registration_deadline}
    lateDeadline={period.late_registration_deadline}
    currentDate={now()}
/>
```

### Status Badge

```tsx
<PeriodStatusBadge status={period.status} />
// Renders:

        <Alert>
            <AlertTitle>Active Period: {activePeriod.school_year}</AlertTitle>
            <AlertDescription>{activePeriod.getDaysRemaining()} days remaining until deadline</AlertDescription>
        </Alert>
    );
}
```

### Timeline Visualization

Visual representation showing:

- Start date marker
- Early deadline (if set)
- Regular deadline (highlighted)
- Late deadline (if set)
- End date marker
- Current date indicator
- Progress bar

### Confirmation Dialogs

- **Activate:** Warns that other active periods will be closed
- **Close:** Confirms closure and shows pending enrollment count
- **Delete:** Double confirmation for destructive action

## Integration Points

### Navigation

Add to Super Admin sidebar:

```tsx
{
  title: "Enrollment Periods",
  url: "/super-admin/enrollment-periods",
  icon: CalendarIcon,
}
```

### Dashboard Widget

Show active period on Super Admin dashboard:

```tsx
<Card>
    <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Active Enrollment Period</CardTitle>
    </CardHeader>
    <CardContent>
        {activePeriod ? (
            <>
                <p className="text-2xl font-bold">{activePeriod.school_year}</p>
                <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">{activePeriod.getDaysRemaining()} days remaining</p>
            </>
        ) : (
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">No active period</p>
        )}
    </CardContent>
</Card>
```
