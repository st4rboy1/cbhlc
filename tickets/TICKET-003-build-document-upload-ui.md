interface DocumentUploadProps {
    studentId: number;
    documentType: string;
    onSuccess?: (document: Document) => void;
    onError?: (error: string) => void;
}
```

### Key Features

- Use HTML5 drag-and-drop API
- Show file preview for images
- Display file size in human-readable format
- Progress bar during upload
- Disable upload button during processing
- Clear file after successful upload

### Example Usage

```tsx
<DocumentUpload
    studentId={student.id}
    documentType="birth_certificate"
    onSuccess={(doc) => {
        toast.success('Document uploaded successfully!');
        refreshDocuments();
    }}
    onError={(error) => {
        toast.error(error);
    }}
/>
```

### Validation Messages

- "Please select a JPEG or PNG file"
- "File size must be less than 50MB"
- "Document uploaded successfully"
- "Failed to upload document. Please try again."

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Drag-and-drop works
- [ ] File picker works
- [ ] Validation messages display
- [ ] Upload progress shows
