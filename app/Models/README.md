## Model Relationships Summary

### User → Guardian → Students → Enrollments → Invoices → Payments → Receipts

**Flow:**

1. User registers and creates Guardian profile
2. Guardian adds Students
3. Guardian submits Enrollments for Students
4. Registrar reviews and approves Enrollments
5. System generates Invoices for approved Enrollments
6. Payments are recorded against Invoices
7. Receipts are generated for Payments

### Supporting Models:

- **SchoolYear & EnrollmentPeriod** - Define when enrollments can happen
- **GradeLevelFee** - Determines how much to charge
- **Document** - Required documents for enrollment
- **SchoolInformation & Setting** - System configuration

---

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. **Activity Logging (Spatie Activitylog)**

Used by: User, Student, Guardian, Enrollment, Document, GradeLevelFee

Provides audit trail for all changes to critical models.

### 2. **Enum Casts**

Used extensively for type safety:

- EnrollmentStatus, PaymentStatus
- GradeLevel
- DocumentType
- Quarter, RelationshipType

### 3. **Observer Pattern**

- EnrollmentObserver: Handles enrollment workflow (ID generation, fee calculation, notifications)
- StudentObserver: Generates student IDs, activity logging

### 4. **Soft Deletes**

Not currently implemented but recommended for:

- Students
- Guardians
- Enrollments (for data retention)

### 5. **Pivot Models**

- GuardianStudent: Rich pivot with relationship_type and is_primary_contact

---

## Database Normalization

The system follows **3NF (Third Normal Form)**:

- No repeating groups
- All non-key attributes depend on the primary key
- No transitive dependencies

**Example:** Fees are stored in GradeLevelFee table, not duplicated in each Enrollment record.

---

## Missing Models (Potential Future Additions)

Based on typical school systems, these models might be needed:

1. **Subject** - For curriculum management
2. **Teacher** - Faculty management
3. **Class/Section** - Class assignments
4. **Grade** - Academic grades/marks
5. **Attendance** - Attendance tracking
6. **Announcement** - School announcements
7. **Calendar/Event** - School events

---

This architecture provides a solid foundation for the enrollment system with clear separation of concerns and good relationship modeling.
